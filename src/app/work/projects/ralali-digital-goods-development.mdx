## Overview

In this project, me and my team focused on migrating legacy service(PHP) from monolith architecture into more scalable microservices with Go and event driven architecture. Starting by designing the new system and architecture, separated by each responsibility for each service.
Create proper documentation, and executing the plan.

## Key Features

- **Microservice**: Make backend services more scalable and easier to maintain.
- **Event Driven Architecture**: To help seemless and fast communication between microservices.
- **Scalable Design System**: Becase we separate each service based on responsibility, it help us to scale the backend easier

## Technologies Used

- **Go**: As programming language for faster performance.
- **MySQL**: Relational database to manage our data.
- **Kafka**: For real time message queue that help each services to communicate.
- **Datadog**: For logging and tracing.

## Challenges and Learnings

One of the biggest challenges was ensuring what services we need and how they can integrate to each other. This involved separation of new services and also their databases, because each new service will have it's own database. Additionally, for event driven architecture we need to make sure what kind of event we need to make our services will run smoothly and fast.

## Outcome

The new microservices make our team more productive because each service has it's own responsibility so it's easier to manage. And for response time we manage to increase it by 500% faster than the legacy.
